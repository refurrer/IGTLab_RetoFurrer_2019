    "### Introduction\n",
    "This file comes in conjunction with the Lab report `IGTLab_RetoFurrer_rep.pdf`. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is prevalent in the worldwide elderly population. In the United States, 15.5 million people (year 2016) have coronary artery diseases [1]. It is a significant cause of mortality in developed countries. However, the mortality due to CAD has gradually declined over the last few decades. Among other reasons, the reduction is caused by the timely percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with balloon catheters [2]. Heavily resistant coronary lesions remain a challenge in interventional cardiology [3, 4]. The inability to fully dilate a lesion can lead to adverse effects, e.g. restenosis [5]. For a successful dilatation of a resistant lesion a high force must be applied to the vessel wall [6]. To exert high forces, the rated burst pressure (RBP) of the device must be high [7]. The cardiovascular system consists of very thin structures [8]. Therefore, the crossing profile of the balloon catheter, i.e. the biggest diameter of the catheter, must be as small as possible. The smaller the crossing profile, the better peripheral coronary arteries can be reached. Designing a balloon catheter with a high pressure resistance within the size limitations, e.g. small crossing profile, is challenging. It is crucial to understand the thin structures and the topology of the polymer materials of a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) catheter to overcome the challenges [9]. The catheter shaft, which is a polymer tube, is beside the balloon, especially crucial for a high RBP [10]. A rupture of the catheter shaft may lead to the inability to deflate the ballon [11].\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard procedure to quantify the topology of polymer tubes is to measure the inner- and outer diameter. The outer diameter is measured with a micrometer or a two-axis laser. The inner diameter is measured with precision mandrels. The current practice can only be applied on a short endsection of the tube. Positions in the middle of the tube cannot be measured, making it difficult to quantify the topology along the tube. The topology may be assessed by a laser-ultrasonic method, which measures the wall thickness along a seamless tube at one angle of that tube [12]. The method is used in tubes with wall thicknesses of about 30 mm and high tolerances [13]. Medical images, e.g. computed tomography are used in the medical field to measure airways wall thicknesses [14, 15, 16, 17]. Micro-computed tomography (μCT) may be used to measure the topology of polymer tubes used in PTCA catheters as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this work is to quantitatively analyse the topology of polymer tube sections based on the outer- and inner diameter along the catheter shaft tube axis. We hypothesize that the shaft topology of a PTCA catheter can be quantified accurately by using μCT images. High resolution μCT images from catheter shaft tubes are theoretically sufficient to analyse their topology. Noise present in the raw images and the image processing algorithm itself, e.g. deviation of edge detection, may introduce some inaccuracies. However, to control the accuracy of the image processing algorithm an own algorithm to evaluate the tube topology is proposed.\n",
    "In this report we present an image processing approach to quantify the topology of a PTCA catheter shaft. μCT images of a polymer tube are the basis for this analysis. In the remainder of the report the topology of two tube samples, plain and necked, are analysed. The deviation to the specification limits for both data sets is investigated. Based on the results of the algorithm, the capabilities to analyse the tubes are evaluated. \n",
    "\n",
    "The image processing approach consits of: (1) Filtering of the image to reduce the image modality noise. (2) Reduction of the image size to the region of interest. (3) Detection of the edges (Canny) and derive the outer diameter in x- and y-direction. (4) Removal of the information around the outer diameter and repeat the edge detection step from 3. to find the inner diameter. (5) Segment and retrive the outer and inner diameter in both, x- and y-direction, and plot results. Since this project is done in the image guided therapy lab of the Biomedical Engineering Program at Univerity of Bern, the ambition is to implement the methods and not just use existing packages, e.g. `pandas` or `OpenCV`."
