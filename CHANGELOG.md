File(s):  IGTLab_RetoFurrer_2019<br/>

## V1 (2019-09-03, 44a5b58)
* Initial Version with basic functionallity
* Outer diameter detection of polymer tube
* Inner diameter cannot be detected (!)
* Based on canny edge detection

## V2 (2019-09-03, 296)
* Optimized inner diameter detection, e.g. masking
* Output of different images for visual checks
* Based on canny edge detection
